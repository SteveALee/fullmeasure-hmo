          <h1>The Student Housing Problem</h1>

          <p class="">
            Developers and landlords have converted houses near to Exeter
            University's main Campus into shared student accommodation called
            Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs).
          </p>

          <p>
            One small area off Union Road has a very high percentage of houses
            converted into HMOs. In 2010 Exeter City Council introduced a
            restriction on further conversions (known as the Article 4
            Directive). This requires planning permission to convert.
          </p>

          <p>
            The restriction has been effective but the Council has recognised that it
            needs extending to a wider area because new HMOs are being developed
            outside the original controlled area. These developments are eroding
            the Council’s aims for “balanced communities”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Specific issues experienced by locals due to this lack of balance
            include:
          </p>

          <ul class="">
            <li>community decline</li>
            <li>late night noise</li>
            <li>increased mess including refuse and broken glass</li>
            <li>reduced parking availability for part of the year</li>

          <h1>Options for New Restricted Area</h1>

          <p class="">
            The Council commissioned a report on extending the current area of 
            restrictions and are now looking for your views on it before 3 Jul.
            There are four proposed options for a new restricted area. These
            are:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              stick with the current area: see
              <a

              >
            </li>
            <li>
              enlarge the area a little: see
              <a
                href="https://res.cloudinary.com/commonplace-digital-limited/image/upload/v1684508784/projects/62b9a83ee0be2b0782bd8556/media-upload/option2.pdf/unq9nqtaaposlvsypwrx.pdf"
                >option 2 map</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              enlarge the area a lot: see
              <a
                href="https://res.cloudinary.com/commonplace-digital-limited/image/upload/v1684508804/projects/62b9a83ee0be2b0782bd8556/media-upload/option3.pdf/oiqyw9fe2sdh6nsjvqmy.pdf"
                >option 3 map</a
              >>
            </li>
            <li>enlarge the area to cover the whole city</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The current Council view is that Option 2 is to be preferred.</p>

          <p>
            However, there are many residents who would prefer at city-wide restriction
            as in Option 4 but it seems that this option is beset by planning
            difficulties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The compromise position is Option 3 and this is probably an
            achievable position which deserves your support.
